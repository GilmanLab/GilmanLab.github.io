The equipment represented here is a culmination of about three years of running a homelab. What's not shown here is the many evolutions that have happened as experience is gained running different brands/types of equipment. The hope is that it can serve as a reference to assist others who may be interested in breaking into the homelab world. Design The following are the primary design principles that went into building out the infrastructure: Silent - A reference point of 50db was chosen, meaning all equipment running at normal load should not produce more than 50db of noise. Efficient - The only ongoing cost of a homelab is power consumption. Thus, where possible, more modern platforms which take advantage of recent advancements to provide more power with less TDP were chosen. For custom builds, highly efficient power supplies and auxiliary cooling were chosen. Compact - The design size of the lab is 22u. Equipment was chosen based on size and the expectation was that it would all fit within an 22u rack with no overflow. Expandable - Where possible, the lab should be relatively easy to grow over the years as needed. This means not relying on niche parts that are hard to come by and using identical components when scaling out.
